This is a Proof Of Concept (POC) that could be used for future authentication security system. 

**The three authentication factors are:**
* Knowledge Factor – something you know (Credentials), e.g., password
* Possession Factor – something you have (Smart devices), e.g., mobile phone
* Inherence Factor – something you are (Biometeric), e.g., fingerprint

This POC project is focusing on the last factor which is *Inherence Factor* as this area is something new that could potentially be used to authenticate user whe logging in to their own account. 

**This POC Project consist of the following when capturing human reaction time:**
* Color test 
* Image test
